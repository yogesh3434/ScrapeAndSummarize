## üß† Web Scraping and AI Summarization with Python & OpenAI
This project combines web scraping with AI-powered content summarization using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. By providing a URL, the script scrapes the webpage content, processes it, 
and returns a concise summary generated by the AI. 
It's a simple yet powerful tool for summarizing large amounts of text quickly and efficiently.

## üöÄ Features
- Extract content from webpage using pre-built API
- Use GPTs 3.5-turbo model to summarize scraped content
- Robust error handling for both AI API requests and web scraping
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3x
- Requests library: For making HTTP requests like GET or POST
- OPEN AI API: For generating summaries using GPT 3.5-turbo
- Web-Scraping API: Pre-built web scraping API used.
